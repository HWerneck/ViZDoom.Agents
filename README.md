# ViZDoom Agents

Repository with implemented ViZDoom agents for my Master's research.

Each repository corresponds to one of the experiments.

The agents were based on Kieliger's tutorials (https://lkieliger.medium.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-practice-by-playing-doom-part-1-getting-started-618c99075c77, https://lkieliger.medium.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-practice-by-playing-doom-part-2-increasing-complexity-6510e7e5c3af and https://lkieliger.medium.com/playing-doom-with-deep-reinforcement-learning-part-3-boosting-performance-with-reward-shaping-b1de246bda1d).
