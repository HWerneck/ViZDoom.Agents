# ViZDoom Agents

Repository with implemented ViZDoom agents.

The first one is a random agent.

The second is the agent I've done based on the Kieliger's tutorials ([https://lkieliger.medium.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-practice-by-playing-doom-part-1-getting-started-618c99075c77]https://lkieliger.medium.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-practice-by-playing-doom-part-1-getting-started-618c99075c77).
