# ViZDoom Agents
Repository with implemented ViZDoom agents.

The first one is a random agent.
The second is the agent I've done base on the Thomas Simonini tutorials (https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course).
The third is my reimplemented version of the second agent, with updated code to reflect the TensorFlow's absortion of Keras.
